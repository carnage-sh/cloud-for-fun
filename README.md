Cloud technologies are fun. They speed up projects, ease changes, reduce cost
and improve security and reliability. `Cloud-for-fun` is a set of code samples
to illustrate some of those Cloud technologies. It sustains, with simple tests
and a few of [my blog articles](https://gregoryguillou.github.io). Have a look,
contact me on and open issues if you need...
